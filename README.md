Hi there, I’m Mary (they/them). I’m an academic with many interests. At the moment, I'm using GitHub as part of my second brain to store notes and edit them across devices.

I’m currently learning how to migrate from Evernote to Markdown files read through Obsidian.

In the near future, I'm considering hosting my blog through GitHub.

You can reach me on Twitter @MarySeph.
